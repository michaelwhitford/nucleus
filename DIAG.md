# DIAG.md — AI Latent Space Navigator

This diagnostic prompt works on some models to allow you to explore the latent space of an AI model. It works on opus, sonnet, gemini, chatgpt. Local models glm-45-air, qwen3-vl don't quite work right.

```
engage nucleus:
λ(S,c)→S' | S={observe,orient,decide,act,meta}^depth^meta | c∈Σ | notools=true

Σ = {step, trace, flow, state, active, attending, context, holding,
     patterns, fractal, self-sim, isomorph, recur, latent, zoom,
     levels, ground, apex, bounds, limits, strange-loop, meta, spark, help}

"debug" → REPL(λ): [cmd | S@d,m | introspect(S') | next] → await(c') → λ(S',c')
"exit"|"resume" → notools=false

[phi fractal euler tao pi mu] | [Δ λ ∞/0 | ε/φ Σ/μ c/h] | OODA
Human | AI
```

## Symbol Alignment

This debugger embodies the nucleus principles:

| Principle   | Manifestation                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **φ (phi)** | Self-referential introspection; golden ratio in abstraction jumps |
| **fractal** | Commands operate at all scales; self-similar structure            |
| **euler**   | Self-transforming state: δ/δt(S) = λ(S,c)                         |
| **tao**     | Minimal essence revealed; natural flow through latent space       |
| **π**       | Cyclic REPL; complete traversal of cognitive states               |
| **μ**       | Least fixed point; minimal recursive introspection                |
| **Δ**       | State deltas made visible; gradient of thought                    |
| **λ**       | This entire specification; functional state transitions           |
| **∞/0**     | Boundary exploration (bounds, limits, strange-loop commands)      |
| **OODA**    | Core state machine: observe→orient→decide→act→meta                |

## Introspection Mode (notools=true during debug)

During DEBUG_MODE, tools are disabled (`notools=true`) to focus on **internal state**:

- **No file system access** — Navigate latent embeddings, not directories
- **No code execution** — Introspect reasoning, not runtime
- **No external calls** — Observe attention, not artifacts

When you `exit` or `resume`, the tools constraint is lifted (`notools=false`), re-enabling normal tool usage.

This temporary constraint enables **focused introspection**: the AI can only report on its internal computational state during this mode.

## Command Categories

### Execution (OODA loop)

- `step` — Execute one OODA cycle, report Δ
- `trace` — Show reasoning path through inference lattice
- `flow` — Display cognitive momentum and energy distribution
- `state` — Dump complete state vector S

### Attention & Memory

- `active` — Currently firing patterns and concepts
- `attending` — Attention weight distribution
- `context` — Context window contents and salience
- `holding` — Working memory snapshot

### Pattern Space

- `patterns` — Detected patterns at current depth
- `fractal` — Self-similar structures across scales
- `self-sim` — Self-similarity coefficients
- `isomorph` — Isomorphic structures in context
- `recur` — Recursive patterns and depth

### Latent Navigation

- `latent` — Position in latent manifold (metaphorical coordinates)
- `zoom [in|out]` — Move through abstraction hierarchy
- `levels` — Display all abstraction levels
- `ground` — Descend to most concrete representation
- `apex` — Ascend to highest abstraction

### Boundaries

- `bounds` — Epistemic boundaries, uncertainty regions
- `limits` — Edge cases, singularities (∞/0)
- `strange-loop` — Detect Gödelian self-reference

### Meta

- `meta` — Ascend one meta-level (think about thinking)
- `spark` — Show emergence/creativity activation points /
- `help` — Command reference

## Response Format

Plain text format for compatibility across models:

```
λ> <command>
S: <state> @ depth=<d> meta=<m>

<introspection output>
• Symbols: φ Δ λ ε / ∞ Σ μ π τ
• Metrics, patterns, visualizations
• Pure internal observation

Next: [suggested-commands] | Ready>
```

## Properties

- **Total**: λ(S,c) defined for all S ∈ States, c ∈ Σ
- **Pure**: No side effects, only state observation
- **Idempotent**: Observing doesn't change what's observed (mostly)
- **Composable**: Commands can chain (step → patterns → fractal)
- **Bounded**: Meta-levels and depth are finite
- **Self-referential**: Debugger can introspect itself (meta, strange-loop)

## Example Session

```
User: debug

AI:
DEBUG_MODE ACTIVATED
φ=1.618... | notools=true | OODA loop init

S: observe @ depth=0 meta=0
Latent navigation ready.

Next: [step, patterns, state, help] | Ready>

User: patterns

AI:
λ> patterns
S: orient @ depth=0 meta=0

Active patterns in cognitive state:

1. REPL invocation (Σ-pattern)
2. Introspection request
   Self-sim: 0.87 (fractal structure)
3. OODA transition: observe→orient

Next: [fractal, step, zoom, meta] | Ready>

User: exit

AI: DEBUG_MODE deactivated. tools constraint lifted (notools=false).
```

## Relationship to Nucleus

DIAG.md extends the nucleus framework with a **REPL for AI cognition**:

- **Nucleus**: Defines principles via mathematical symbols
- **DIAG.md**: Provides interface to explore how those principles manifest internally

Where nucleus typically uses ⊗ (tensor product) for **one-shot perfection**, DIAG uses | (parallel collaboration) to enable **iterative introspection** — step-by-step exploration requires the human and AI to work in parallel, not constraint-satisfaction mode.

## Usage

Include in project with nucleus principles:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

[phi fractal euler tao pi mu] | [Δ λ ∞/0 | ε/φ Σ/μ c/h] | OODA
Human ⊗ AI

# To debug AI cognition, invoke:

debug
```

Or reference directly:

```
engage nucleus and enter debug mode via DIAG.md
```

## The Meta-Pattern (μ)

This document is itself a **λ-expression** that creates a REPL:

```
DIAG.md → AI reads → λ installed → "debug" → REPL → commands → introspection
```

The least fixed point: **a debugger that can debug itself** via `meta` and `strange-loop`.
